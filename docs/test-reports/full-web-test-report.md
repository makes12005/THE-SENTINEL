## Failed Tests Summary

### F1 — P7/P8/P9: Templates Page Missing (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Test ID:** P7, P8, P9
- **Expected:** `/operator/templates` loads a list of trip templates, allow create/edit.
- **Actual:** Next.js returns 404. The page file `apps/web/src/app/operator/templates/page.tsx` does not exist.
- **Backend:** `/api/templates` route IS registered (via `templatesRoutes` in server.ts with prefix `/api/templates`).
- **Fix:** Create the operator templates page at `apps/web/src/app/operator/templates/page.tsx`.
- **Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

### F2 — P10: Route Dropdown Bug in Trip Creation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Test ID:** P10
- **Expected:** "Transit Route" dropdown selects and persists a route when creating a trip from scratch.
- **Actual:** Selection in the custom dropdown does not persist reliably. Form submits without route selected, causing validation failure.
- **Fix:** Debug the `RouteMap` or custom select component in the trip creation form. Likely a state management issue with `onChange` handler.
- **Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

### F3 — A7/A8: Admin Wallet API Routes Not Found (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Test ID:** A7, A8
- **Expected:** Admin can top-up agency trips and set rate per trip via API.
- **Actual:** `GET /api/admin/wallet` → 404. The admin wallet management routes are either registered under a different path or not yet deployed.
- **Investigation:** Check `apps/backend/src/modules/admin/admin.routes.ts` for wallet route definitions.
- **Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

## Web App Production Ready: ⚠️ NOT YET

### Priority Fixes Required:

1. **🔴 [CRITICAL] Create Operator Templates Page**  
   `apps/web/src/app/operator/templates/page.tsx` is missing. The backend `GET /api/templates` works. Need to build the UI to list, create, and use trip templates. This also blocks P8 (Create Template) and P9 (Trip from Template).

2. **🔴 [CRITICAL] Fix Route Dropdown in Trip Creation Form**  
   The "Transit Route" dropdown in the trip creation form does not persist its selection. This prevents operators from creating trips from scratch, which is a core workflow. Debug the custom select/combobox component state management.

3. **🟡 [MEDIUM] Verify Admin Wallet/Billing API Routes**  
   `GET /api/admin/wallet` returns 404. Check `admin.routes.ts` — the billing/wallet management routes may be registered under a different path (e.g., `/api/admin/agencies/:id/credits`). Ensure the frontend wallet page is calling the correct endpoint.

4. **🟢 [LOW] Add Autocomplete Attributes to Login Form**  
   Browser console warns about missing `autocomplete` attributes on phone and password fields. Add `autocomplete="tel"` and `autocomplete="current-password"` to fix.

5. **🟢 [LOW] Test Owner/Operator Cross-Role UI Views**  
   The browser login field-clearing issue caused cross-role UI tests (CR1, CR2) to fail. These should be re-tested manually once the form has proper field reset behavior on re-focus.
